        <h1>Guy-Manuel </h1>
	<br>
	<h2>Early Life</h2>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">Born on February 8, 1974, Guy-Manuel grew up in Paris, where his passion for music blossomed during his childhood. At the age of 7, he received a toy guitar and keyboard, fueling his obsession with musical creativity. It wasn't until he was 14 and acquired an electric guitar that he truly began expressing his passion.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">
During his school years, Guy-Manuel met <i><a href="thomas.html" target="_blank">Thomas Bangalter</a></i>, and their shared infatuation with music and other media quickly forged a strong friendship. They toyed around with making music together and eventually formed a rock band called "Darlin'" with Laurent Brancowitz, using it as an outlet for their collective adolescent creative exploration. While Darlin' didn't last long, a certain negative review they received would have a lasting impact.
</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Electronic Icons</h2>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">In a May 1993 edition of the British music magazine "Melody Maker," Darlin's music was described as "a bunch of daft punky thrash." The group found the review amusing, but that particular excerpt stuck with them.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">Despite Darlin's disbandment, Thomas and Guy-Manuel's friendship endured, and they continued to nurture their creative passions and love for music. In 1992, after a night at a nightclub where their interest in electronic music was sparked, they decided to embark on a new venture in that direction, naming it "Daft Punk." </p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">Thomas' expertise in music production technology and drive to experiment complemented Guy-Manuel's meticulous and critical mind when it came to electronic soundscapes. Together, they formed a perfect yin and yang dynamic that kept their music innovative while still respecting the fundamentals of the genre.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">As the years passed, Daft Punk continued to release albums filled with chart-topping hits and bring dance music to wider audiences. International tours, movie soundtracks, grammy awards and more came and went, further etching the legacy of the famous French duo.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Other Ventures</h2>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">Outside of Daft Punk, Guy-Manuel established his own record label, "Crydamoure," in 1997. The label provided an avenue for exploring creative options and experimenting with electronic sounds that didn't align with Daft Punk's vision. Crydamoure eventually housed around 10 artists, releasing several compilation albums over the years. However, in 2006, Guy-Manuel decided to refocus on Daft Punk with Thomas, leading to the liquidation of Crydamoure.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">While Guy-Manuel's production credits may not be as extensive as his robot counterparts, he has been involved in several notable releases. In 2010, he co-produced the track "Nightcall" with French house artist Kavinsky, which gained prominence for its inclusion in the 2011 film "Drive" starring Ryan Gosling. Additionally, in 2018, Guy-Manuel co-produced the track "Hurt You" for The Weeknd's "My Dear Melancholy" EP, alongside French DJ Gesaffelstein.</p>
