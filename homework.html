        <h1>Homework</h1>
        
	
	<p class="mmbs2">17th of January, 1997</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">
The revolutionary debut release from Daft Punk, Homework, shifted the course of electronic music forever. It was released in 1997, following a handful of innovative singles that had been sprinkled throughout prior years. These singles built curiosity and anticipation surrounding the two French DJs, who were trying something different with a genre that desperately needed innovation.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">None of the entries on the album's 16-song track list were initially intended to be part of an album. Instead, they were simply the product of the duo spontaneously creating music for periodic single releases. However, Guy-Manuel and Thomas were producing music at such a rapid pace that the concept of a full-fledged album release started to make more sense.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">Due to the album essentially being a compilation of the best songs the duo created over a few months, it lacks a consistent theme or sequencing that is often found in albums. The overall sporadic nature becomes evident when listening to the album, as it recklessly bounces between different ideas and sounds.</p>
	<br>
	<p class=mmbs2>The name "Homework" is quite literal, as the entire album was recorded in Thomas Bangalter's home studio. He had dismantled his bedroom and brought in all the necessary tools of the trade to create a makeshift recording space.</p>
	<br>
	<p class=mmbs2>Despite Homework being little more than an amalgamation of tracks thrown together in an apartment bedroom, the precise and meticulous production that Daft Punk became known for was ever-present. It was this uniquely high attention to detail combined with their drive to innovate that gave birth to hits like "Around The World," quickly establishing the two Frenchmen as pioneers of the genre.</p>
	<br>
	<p class=mmbs2>Even to this day, Homework's influence resonates throughout music production across every genre. It paved the way for electronic music to be perceived as far less of a niche underground genre confined to dingy nightclubs and more as a legitimate new flavor of music.
    <br>
	<br>
    <p class=mmbs2>Ultimately, Homework served as the perfect foundation and introduction for Daft Punk's legendary and revolutionary career.</p>
