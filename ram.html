Random Access Memories saw the duo reverting back to what they did best: masterfully blending genres and manipulating samples to create innovative sounds and catchy hits that were destined to dominate charts and stereo systems worldwide. And that's exactly what RAM accomplished.</p>
	<br>
	<p>
Similar to Discovery, Random Access Memories drew heavily from the duo's childhood influences and wholeheartedly embraced its inspiration, embedding it deeply into the essence of the music. Many consider RAM to be a tribute to the era and genre of 1970s American disco/funk, which it skillfully incorporates into its style.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In true Daft Punk album fashion, Random Access Memories boasted its own set of hits that were bound to dominate the airwaves, to the point where you might grow tired of hearing them. The album's lead single, "Get Lucky," turned out to be the duo's most commercially successful song ever, earning two Grammys and solidifying Thomas and Guy-Manuel's mastery of their craft. The infectious chorus and captivating guitar licks of the song embedded themselves in the ears of listeners worldwide as it ruled the charts throughout the year.</p>
	<br>
	
<p>Random Access Memories built upon the elements that made "Homework" and "Discovery" so special, while showcasing the duo's ability to incorporate different genre elements and push the boundaries of electronic music. It crafted a truly unique and timeless sound. In retrospect, knowing that it was their final album, it serves as the perfect swan song to their legendary musical career.</p>
