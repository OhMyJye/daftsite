        <h1>Thomas</h1>
        <br>
	<h2>Early Life</h2>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">Born on the 3rd of January 1975 in Paris into a family with a background in music, it was natural that Thomas developed a strong passion and appreciation for art from a young age. At the age of 6, he began playing the piano and continued to develop his skills through lessons and intensive practice that his parents strongly encouraged.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">
While in 8th grade in 1987, Bangalter met <a href="guy.html" title="Guy" target="_blank">Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo</a>. They quickly developed a strong bond over their mutual love of music from decades prior. Later in high school, they both started an indie punk band with Laurent Brancowitz (who later went on to be the guitarist in the French pop rock band Phoenix) named Darlin’, where Thomas played the bass guitar. The band was short-lived, but somewhere along the way received a critical review from a British music magazine that dubbed their music as “a daft punky thrash.” – I don’t think I need to tell you what that ended up inspiring.
</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Robot Revolution</h2>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">5 years later, in 1992, Thomas and Guy-Manuel started to grow fond of electronic music, and decided they wanted to shift towards playing around with the idea of making music that leaned into the genre. After a few years of demo tapes, nightclub gigs, and some popular singles, Thomas and Guy-Manuel shifted towards focusing on getting a debut album for Daft Punk out into the world.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">In 1997, Daft Punk released Homework to widespread acclaim and commercial success. All of a sudden, the niche house music duo wasn’t so niche, and it didn’t take long for headlining spots at music festivals and international concerts to become the new normal for Daft Punk.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">Outside of the massive success Thomas was having with his childhood friend under Daft Punk, he was also working on solo productions and a few other projects here and there with friends, like the 1998 chart topper “Music Sounds Better With You”, which he made with two close friends and released under the group name “Stardust”.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">Finding Bangalter’s name listed in the credits of songs quickly became synonymous with innovative production and commercial success, cementing his place in the music industry, and shaping the sounds of every genre he touched.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">As the years passed, Daft Punk continued to release albums filled with chart-topping hits and bring dance music to wider audiences. International tours, movie soundtracks, grammy awards and more came and went, further etching the legacy of the famous French duo.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Nothing Lasts Forever</h2>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">In 2021, Thomas and Guy-Manuel officially disbanded Daft Punk and hung up the iconic robot helmets for good after 24 years of redefining dance music.</p>
	<br>
	<p class="mmbs2">Thomas continues his passion for music elsewhere to this day, where he has been spotted in studio sessions with pop stars like Lil Nas X, and most recently creating the score for a French ballet titled Mythologies in 2022.</p>
